**Random Quote Machine** is a project that is a part of the **"Front End Development Libraries"** course hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**.
The program fetches the data regarding the courses from a url. That data is then displayed to the user. In order to complete this
program, I used **Bootstrap 3** and **JQuery**.
