This is a project that is a part of the *Front End Development Libraries* course hosted by **FreeCodeCamp**.
The program fetches the data from a url that has a JSON object containing a bunch of quotes. A quote will be
randomly selected from the received JSON object, after which it will be displayed.

This project is a part of **FreeCodeCamp** *Front End Development Libraries Course*. Some of the code in their
example project has been used, along some ideas. The UI and styling were made by me, along parts of the code.
